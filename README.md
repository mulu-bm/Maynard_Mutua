# Maynard_Mutua

ENVIRON859 Fall 2024 Final Project

Folder structure:
Docs - Contains a Word document titled 'ENV859_FinalCommentary_MaynardMutua' with commentary describing our analysis. Read this to further understand the project overview and key results.
Scratch - Stores intermediate files used in the analysis.
Processed - Stores the final processed files from the analysis. 
Scripts - Contains a python notebook titled 'DataExploration.ipynb' outlining our data exploration and wrangling steps. The rest of the scripts in the folders are the final scripts for use as tools in ArcGIS.
ExtremeWeatherImpacts.aprx is the ArcGIS project that can be used to run the scripts developed through the project.

Note: there is no raw data folder in the folder structure since all raw data is dynamically pulled from the API and stored in the Scratch folder as needed.
